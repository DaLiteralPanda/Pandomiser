# Contributing to Pandomiser

First off, I want to thank you for taking the time to test this repository, wanting to contribute and actually reading the docs!

### Code of conduct
The code of conduct can be viewed over [here](), but I use the default Code of Conduct from the [contributor covenant website](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), so it might be better to look at that.

### What you should know for a better issue/pull request
There's currently no commands to get info on the bot version or anything but we are currently working on a stats command so you would also be able to see what version you are working in. We will keep this file updated.

### Want to contribute?
I would absolutely love it if you were to contribute to this bot, the more help we can get on this the better it'll become and the more we can learn from others.
Bug reports and pull requests are absolutely welcome on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/DaLiteralPanda/Pandomiser/). This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, which is why we would love it if you made issues and/or pull requests, however, contributors still are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

#### What if I want to help but can't contribute?
There's more than enough ways you can help! For example:
* Something broken? File an issue! Bonus points if you try to fix it. It helps if you include the bot version, OS details and what we could do to reproduce this issue!
* Look through [open issues](https://github.com/DaLiteralPanda/Pandomiser?state=open) and see if there's a topic or application you happen to have experience with!
* Got any ideas for what to add to this? Shoot us a DM on [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/xE4R7FwDcX) or use the `p!suggestion` command and we'll add it to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xc3G3hST/pandomiser-projects)

Thanks for reading!
