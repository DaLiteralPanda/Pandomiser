This is a discord bot (written in NodeJS) that is based on randomisation, meaning it can send random things. Do `p!help` to see all the functions of this bot!
Its developed by [@William](https://github.com/LucAngevare/), [@Me](https://github.com/DaLiteralPanda) (aka Panda), [@Idhank](https://github.com/iddev5) and [@Riad](https://github.com/Riad-pixel) (Who raids local bakeries on a daily basis)

The bot is very new but it offers some basic functions like

Generating a random question (conversation starter)

Generating a random word

Generating a random quote through a Markov chain (made by [Will](https://github.com/LucAngevare/), these quotes are not real and are generated just for fun.)

And many more are to come!

You can also recommend things (join the [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/Gh47KDp), or use the `p!suggestion` command in any server)
